The major addition to the game is the implementation of a maze generation algorithm which utilises recursive division to draw an almost-perfect maze. It’s a very efficient algorithm and places the mines very nicely. I decided to implement the generation of the mines early on because I did not want to deal with reading level data from anywhere or writing the levels by hand:   Additionally, the cells count the mines on themselves and the bombs on their adjacent tiles horizontally and vertically and they print the number correctly to the screen, like “illustrated” in the following screenshot
